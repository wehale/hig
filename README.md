Hockey Interview Generator

This is a simple node app that will generate a random hockey interview. Now updated to produce an actual interview with some random player from some random team. Also updated to actually speak the interview through the speakers or run as a webserver.

## Usage:  
//start the web server  
> npm start  

// output to the command line  
> npm test  

//speak through the speakers (Mac and now Windows also supported - Thanks @paulr34 !)  
> npm run speak
